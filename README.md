# Creative Adversarial Networks
A WIP implementation of [CAN: Creative Adversarial Networks, Generating "Art" 
by Learning About Styles and Deviating from Style Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07068). 
Repo bases DCGAN implementation on [DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) 
with modifications to reduce checkerboard artifacts according to [this 
distill article](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/)

The paper authors basically modified the GAN objective to encourage the network to deviate away from art norms.
